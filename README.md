**Objective:**

In this project, my main objective is to conduct a comprehensive study and analysis of hotel booking and cancellation patterns using PowerBI. This involves examining a large dataset to identify trends, correlations, and potential causative factors behind booking behaviors and cancellations. By leveraging PowerBI's advanced data visualization and analytical capabilities, I aim to uncover insights into peak booking times, cancellation rates, customer preferences, and the impact of various factors such as seasonality, booking channels, and lead times. The ultimate goal is to pinpoint probable reasons for cancellations and suggest data-driven solutions to improve booking retention, enhance customer satisfaction, and increase overall profitability for the business. This analysis will provide actionable insights to optimize operational strategies and drive business growth.

**Business KPI's:**

1. Cancellation Rate
2. Booking Status
3. Hotel Type
4. Number of Stays
5. Average Daily rate
6. Countries contributing in hotel bookings/ cancellations
7. Visitors Type
8. Arival time of most customers

**Conclusion:**

This dataset contains 119390 observations for City Hotel and Resort Hotel. Each observation represents a Hotel booking between 1st July 2015 to 31st August 2017, including booking that arrived early and booking that were canceled.
